Let's talk about leadership. A great leader sets an example for others to follow.
They lead by example, showing integrity, resilience, and a strong work ethic.
When a leader sets a positive example, it inspires the team and creates a culture of success.
For example, Nelson Mandela is often cited as an exemplary leader who fought for equality and
justice, leaving a lasting legacy for future generations.

In the field of education, examples play a crucial role in learning.
They provide concrete illustrations of abstract concepts, making them easier to understand.
For example, when teaching mathematics, using real-life examples helps students grasp complex
equations and formulas. By applying these examples to everyday situations, students can see the relevance
and practicality of what they're learning.
