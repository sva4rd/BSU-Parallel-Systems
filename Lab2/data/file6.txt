In the world of technology, having a good example is crucial.
It serves as a reference point, a guide to follow.
An example demonstrates how things can be done and provides inspiration for innovation.
For instance, take the smartphone industry. The iPhone is a prime example of a
game-changing device that revolutionized the way we communicate and access information.
It set the example for other manufacturers to strive for excellence.
