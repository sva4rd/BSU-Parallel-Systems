In a realm where each stride unveils a mystery,
Where wisdom blooms with the passing of days.
We seek a path to reach the heights,
Where knowledge shines like the morning rays.

Paths intertwine in the quest for truth,
Guiding us through life's intricate maze.
With every lesson learned and challenge met,
We find our way, our spirits ablaze.

In pursuit of dreams, we find our course,
Steered by hope's unwavering gaze.
And at the journey's end, we'll stand atop,
Greeting the dawn of brighter days.
