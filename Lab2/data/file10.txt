In a world of constant change,
Where every step is a new example.
We seek the path to success,
Through examples that lead us to the peak.

Example is the key to knowledge,
That opens doors to the future.
With every example, we grow,
And understand the essence of life.

In every action, in every word,
Example is our navigator.
It helps us move forward,
And become a bit wiser.

So let the example be the light,
In a tunnel full of challenges.
And may it lead us to heights,
Where new discoveries await.
